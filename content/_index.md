I'm Katja from Finland and I am somewhat tired of social media.

This blog is a social media free (hence no commenting either) place for me to write down things that I learn, find interesting, find irritating, or just want to write about for some other reason :shrug:

Depending on the mood, some might be in Finnish but majority will probably be in English.
